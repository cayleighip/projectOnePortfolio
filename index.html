        <h2>Design Bio</h2>
           <p>Hello, my name is Cayleigh Ip and I am a Visual Communication major at San Francisco State University while minoring in marketing. I am a Chinese-Filipino American from Richmond, California. </p> 
            <p>My cultural heritage has always influenced my design, driving a passion for art from a young age. For instance, for my Graphic Design I class, in the Rebrand project I incorporated Chinese values to create a new logo design for a local business.</p>
            <p>Inclusivity is a core value in my design philosophy. I strive to ensure that everyone feels seen and represented in my work. I believe it's essential to listen to clients' input and concerns to craft cohesive and consistent visual identities to reflect their values and needs. My attention to detail and thorough iterative design process emphasize empathy throughout every project.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies that I enjoy doing in my free time are scrapbooking, reading, baking, and cooking. My interests in social media design, particularly within football (soccer) and music, continue to fuel my passion for design. I am particularly inspired by music tour poster designs and the graphic design work in football, which constantly inspire my creativity.</p>
            <p>I am dedicated to continuously learning and evolving with the ever-changing field of design.</p>

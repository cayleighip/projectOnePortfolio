        <h2>Design Bio</h2>
           <p>Cayleigh Ip is a student at San Francisco State University majoring in Visual Communication Design while minoring in Marketing. She is of Chinese-Filipino descent from Richmond, California. </p> 
           <br>
            <p>Her cultural heritage has always influenced her design, driving a passion for art from a young age. For instance, in her Graphic Design I class, for the Rebrand project she incorporated Chinese values to create a new logo design for a local business in the San Francisco community.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inclusivity is a core value in her design philosophy. She strives to ensure that everyone feels seen and represented in her work. She believes it's essential to listen to clients' input and concerns to craft cohesive and consistent visual identities to reflect their values and needs. Cayleigh's attention to detail and thorough iterative design process emphasize empathy throughout every project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of her hobbies that she enjoys doing in her free time are scrapbooking, reading, baking, and cooking. Her interests in social media design, particularly within football (soccer) and music, continue to fuel her passion for design. Cayleigh is particularly inspired by music tour poster designs and the graphic design work in football, which constantly inspire her creativity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cayleigh is dedicated to continuously learning and evolving with the ever-changing field of design.</p>

<!-- By this point you should have:

all of your content loaded into your HTML (images and copy)
it is okay to still have placeholder images, but you will want feedback on your images, so aim to get this complete
your HTML should be 95-100% complete 
meaning it should be all organized into div tags for the most part (this will change a little as we learn about flexboxes)
and you should be around 30-50% done with your CSS.
have the bases set up in your CSS, * & body selectors for sure
have fonts in place
have colors in place, both background and text. -->

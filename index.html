            Her cultural heritage has always influenced her design, driving a passion for art from a young age. For instance, in her Graphic Design I class, for the Rebrand project she incorporated Chinese values to create a new logo design for a local business in the San Francisco community.

            <br>

            Inclusivity is a core value in her design philosophy. She strives to ensure that everyone feels seen and represented in her work. She believes it's essential to listen to clients' input and concerns to craft cohesive and consistent visual identities to reflect their values and needs. Cayleigh's attention to detail and thorough iterative design process emphasize empathy throughout every project.

            <br>
            <br>

            Some of her hobbies that she enjoys doing in her free time are scrapbooking, reading, baking, and cooking. Her interests in social media design, particularly within football (soccer) and music, continue to fuel her passion for design. Cayleigh is particularly inspired by music tour poster designs and the graphic design work in football, which constantly inspire her creativity.

            <br>
            <br>

            Cayleigh is dedicated to continuously learning and evolving with the ever-changing field of design.
